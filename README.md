# term-screener
Screen a set of documents for given terms.

## Capabilities
Given a directory of PDF files encoded with text metadata and a complete terms input table, *check_for_terms.py* will search each PDF for submitted terms and variations. The script will output, in CSV format, a matrix identifying which of the documents contain which of the submitted terms.

## Instructions
1. Following the format of `terms_template.csv`, list all terms and variations to find. Column descriptions:
   - Canonical - The shared name you want to use for a given term or set of term variations; The results report by unique Canonical
   - Variation - A specific instance of a term that the tool should match; Any Variation of a single Canonical will flag the Canonical as present
   - Exclude - True will remove the term from text before searching; False will search for the term
   - MatchPunctuation - True will match based on punctuation; False will ignore punctuation
   - MatchCase - True will match based on case/capitalization; False will ignore case/capitalization
2. Place all PDF files to search within one directory. Files can be in subdirectories.
1. Run `check_for_terms.py`.
   1. When prompted, select your CSV file of terms to find.
   1. When prompted, select a directory containing all PDF files to search. The script will search this directory and its subdirectories.
1. Find results in your directory of PDFs, filename `results_*YYYY-MM-DD*.csv`.

## Aspirations
- Add error-handling for missing/unexpected values in the terms input table.
- Make script executable.
